# portfolio_website

❗WIP❗

This is the repository for my portfolio website build. I have created this project with the goal of using it to present some information about me and the work I have done. 
It is very simple: created with basic HTML, CSS and Javscript instead of React as I believe using a javascript framework for a simple
project like this is unecessary. 
 
🖥️Tech-stack:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Vercel/Netlify
