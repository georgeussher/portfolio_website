❗WIP❗

This is the repository for my portfolio website build. I have created this project with the goal of using it to present some information about me and the projects I have done. 
It is very simple: created with basic HTML, CSS and Javscript instead of React as I believe using a javascript framework for a simple
project like this is unecessary.
