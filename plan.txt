MVP:
A deployed webiste that presents and intro about me, my projects
and my contact info. Each section can be accessed through its own 
button in the tab section that takes the user to the corresponding part 
of the site.
Each project has a link that takes the user to the public github repo.
Supplemental images will also be provided in the my work section.

HTML:
contains the text that is presented on the webpage. Placeholder text 
used initally.

CSS:
use flexbox to style the navbar in order to ge the two-tone appearence set out in the wireframe.

Javascript:
so far no use for javascript but would be good to find a way to include it to 
show my javascript skills (parallax?)

API: 
API to store contact information that is served when the contact me button is clicked
